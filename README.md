Things we did wrong:
They didn't communicate throughout the process, didn't keep each other up on the changes they were making.  Conflicts because they weren't on the same page.

Both groups pushed into main.


Things they should have done but failed to do:
Bob and Carol didn't do a "git pull origin master/main"
They should have communicated throughout the process.
Both groups should have been working in a branch instead of on Main.

What we did:
We fixed the merge conflict that Bob and Carol caused by deleting the mistakes/redundant code and merging the branches before pulling it back down to our computers.

When both groups attempted to push into main the first groups push was deleted by the second groups.
